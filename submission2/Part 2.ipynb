    "\n",
    "In the example given by Khan Academy[1], we can see that the exchange rate between Peso and Euro is defined by:\n",

    "- Different amount of Euros supplied at different rate of Peso per Euro, forming the supply curve\n",

    "\n",
    "### Interest Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "One such example is the interest rate of a country. When interest rates increases, savers from other countries will be encouraged to buy financial assets in that country[1]. That will require foreign savers to first buy the country's currency to buy the financial assets. This results in higher demand for the country's currency, resulting in increased exhange rate. \n",

    "### Money Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "The money supply of the country affects the supply of the currency directly. An increase in money supply results in a decrease in equilibrium FX[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "One metrics that is available is M1 which directly measures physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers checks, other checkable deposits and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts[3]. Basically, the most liquid form of money in a country.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a country with a consistently lower inflation rate exhibits a rising currency value, as its purchasing power increases relative to other currencies. [4]\n",

    "### Industrial Production Index \n",
    "\n",
    "The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) has shown to be dependent on the exchange rate[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Political Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Political stability of a country also affects the exchange rate positively. Investors are encouraged to invest in countries with higher political stability, resulting in higher demand for the currency[4]."
